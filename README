# Linuxtrack Modernized (Proton & Qt6 Edition)

[![CI/CD Build](https://github.com/StarTuz/linuxtrack/actions/workflows/build-release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/StarTuz/linuxtrack/actions)

This is a modernized fork of the [Linuxtrack](https://github.com/uglyDwarf/linuxtrack) project, updated to support modern Linux desktop standards (Qt6, Wayland, Modern OpenGL) and specifically optimized for **Proton/Steam Deck** environments.

## 🚀 Key Modernizations

This version addresses deep technical debt to ensure long-term stability:

- **Surgical Wine Injection**: No more fragile `.exe` installers! Directly inject bridge DLLs into Wine/Proton prefixes with one click.
- **Proton-Aware Environment**: Automatically configures `PROTON_NO_FSYNC` and `PROTON_NO_ESYNC` to prevent race conditions and tracking stutters in games like *Elite Dangerous*.
- **Qt6 & Wayland Support**: Fully ported from Qt4/5 to Qt6. Removed `QtX11Extras` to allow the GUI to run natively on Wayland.
- **Modern OpenGL (3.0+)**: Rewrote the 3D Tracking View using a programmable shader-based pipeline (GLES 3.0), replacing the broken 20-year-old fixed-function legacy code.
- **Bison/Flex Removal**: Replaced complex legacy configuration parsers with the lightweight, robust `mINI` library.
- **TrackIR 5 V3 Support**: Full hardware activation for the latest TrackIR 5 revisions (using optimized 0x1A/0x1B initialization packets).

## 🎮 Verified Games & Apps

- ✅ **Elite Dangerous** (Proton 10/Steam Launcher)
- ✅ **X-Plane 12** (Native Linux Plugin)


## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Build from Source
```bash
./configure --prefix=/opt/linuxtrack
make
sudo make install
```

### 2. Configure Wine/Proton Support
1. Open `ltr_gui`.
2. Go to the **Misc.** tab.
3. Click **"Install Linuxtrack-Wine support..."**.
4. Choose **"Yes"** for **Surgical Injection**.
5. Select your game's Wine prefix (e.g., `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/359320/pfx` for Elite Dangerous).
