# Linuxtrack Modernized (Proton & Qt6 Edition)

[![CI/CD Build](https://github.com/StarTuz/linuxtrack/actions/workflows/build-release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/StarTuz/linuxtrack/actions)

This is a modernized fork of the [Linuxtrack](https://github.com/uglyDwarf/linuxtrack) project, updated to support modern Linux desktop standards (Qt6, Wayland, Modern OpenGL) and specifically optimized for **Proton/Steam Deck** environments.

## 🚀 Key Modernizations

Unlike other legacy forks, this version addresses deep technical debt to ensure long-term stability:

- **Native Firmware Manager (LAL)**: New "Manage Assets" GUI allows legal, drag-and-drop installation of proprietary TrackIR/SmartNav firmware without needing Wine or external tools.
- **Surgical Wine Injection**: No more fragile `.exe` installers! Directly inject bridge DLLs into Wine/Proton prefixes with one click.
- **Proton-Aware Environment**: Automatically configures `PROTON_NO_FSYNC` and `PROTON_NO_ESYNC` to prevent race conditions and tracking stutters in games like *Elite Dangerous*.
- **Qt6 & Wayland Support**: Fully ported from Qt4/5 to Qt6. Removed `QtX11Extras` to allow the GUI to run natively on Wayland.
- **Modern OpenGL (3.0+)**: Rewrote the 3D Tracking View using a programmable shader-based pipeline (GLES 3.0), replacing the broken 20-year-old fixed-function legacy code.
- **Bison/Flex Removal**: Replaced complex legacy configuration parsers with the lightweight, robust `mINI` library.
- **TrackIR 5 V3 Support**: Full hardware activation for the latest TrackIR 5 revisions.
- **Unified UDP Bridge**: New high-precision UDP stack that solves symmetry and range issues in full-screen games. Uses a unique coordinated architecture where hotkeys (Wine) trigger server-side (Linux) recentering on port 4243.

## 🎮 Verified Games & Apps

- ✅ **DCS World** (Proton, with Controller.exe hotkeys)
- ✅ **Elite Dangerous** (Proton 10/Steam Launcher, symmetric range via UDP)
- ✅ **Train Sim World 6** (Proton, full 6DOF via UDP Bridge)
- ✅ **X-Plane 12** (Native Linux Plugin)
- ✅ **X4 Foundations** (Via ltr_udp)

## 🔧 Hardware Setup (TrackIR/SmartNav)

### Udev Rules (Required for USB Access)

Your TrackIR/SmartNav device needs udev rules so Linux can access it without root privileges.

**Step 1: Copy the rules file**

```bash
# If installed to /opt/linuxtrack:
sudo cp /opt/linuxtrack/share/linuxtrack/99-TIR.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

# If using the AppImage, extract it first:
./Linuxtrack-*.AppImage --appimage-extract
sudo cp squashfs-root/usr/share/linuxtrack/99-TIR.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
```

**Step 2: Reload udev rules**

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

**Step 3: Unplug and replug your TrackIR device**

> [!TIP]
> If you still see "permissions problem" after following these steps, try logging out and back in, or rebooting.

### IR LEDs Turn Off Immediately

If your TrackIR's IR LEDs flash briefly then turn off, your hardware may need a timing delay:

1. Open `ltr_gui` and go to your TrackIR device settings
2. In the **Troubleshooting** section, find **Video On Delay**
3. Set it to `120000` (120ms) or higher
4. Restart tracking

> [!NOTE]
> This setting adds a delay (in microseconds) after enabling video before turning on the IR LEDs. Some TrackIR hardware revisions require this stabilization period.

### X-Plane Plugin: linuxtrack.so Not Found (AppImage)

If X-Plane fails to load the plugin or reports `linuxtrack.so` is missing when using the AppImage:

1. Open `ltr_gui` (from the AppImage).
2. Go to **Misc.** -> **Install X-Plane plugin...**.
3. When prompted, allow the app to install **stable libraries** to `~/.local`.
4. This copies the necessary `.so` files to a location X-Plane can see after the AppImage is closed.

### Jittery/Noisy Tracking (One Euro Filter)

If your tracking feels jittery compared to Windows, you can enable the **One Euro Filter** - an open-source, adaptive smoothing algorithm designed specifically for motion tracking:

The filter is available per-axis in your profile settings and can be enabled programmatically. Two parameters control its behavior:

| Parameter | Effect | Range | Default |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| **min_cutoff** | Jitter reduction (higher = less smoothing) | 0.5-5.0 | 1.0 |
| **beta** | Responsiveness (higher = more responsive to fast moves) | 0.0-0.1 | 0.007 |

> [!TIP]
> Start with `min_cutoff = 1.0` and `beta = 0.007`. Increase `min_cutoff` if tracking feels laggy. Increase `beta` if fast movements feel sluggish.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Build from Source (CMake)

**Prerequisites:** Qt6 (likely 6.10+ recommended), OpenGLES/OpenGL drivers, libusb-1.0, libmxml, liblo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StarTuz/linuxtrack.git
cd linuxtrack
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

### 2. AppImage Distribution

**Generic AppImage:** The generic CI build is currently experimental due to Qt6 ABI complexity.
**Arch Linux AppImage:** A verified, working AppImage (built against Arch system Qt) is available. This version uses the host system's Qt libraries for maximum compatibility on rolling release distros.

### 3. Configure Wine/Proton Support

1. Open `ltr_gui`.
2. Go to the **Misc.** tab.
3. Click **"Install Linuxtrack-Wine support..."**.
4. Select your game's Wine prefix from the auto-discovered list.
5. Controller.exe is automatically installed for Pause/Recenter hotkeys.

## ⌨️ Native Hotkeys (Wayland/X11)

The `ltr_hotkeyd` daemon provides global hotkeys for recenter and pause without needing alt-tab.

### Default Hotkeys

| Action | Key |
| --- | --- |
| Recenter Tracking | F12 |
| Toggle Pause | Pause |

### Wayland Support

On Wayland (KDE Plasma, GNOME), shortcuts are registered via `xdg-desktop-portal` GlobalShortcuts interface. You can customize them in your desktop's **System Settings → Shortcuts → LinuxTrack**.

### X11 Support

On X11 sessions, the daemon uses traditional `XGrabKey` for global hotkey capture.

### Starting the Daemon

Enable **"Native Hotkeys"** in the Misc tab of `ltr_gui`, or run manually:

```bash
ltr_hotkeyd --verbose --profile="YourProfileName"
```
